                    So, this is where it all begins... <br> When I look back, this looks like the first thing I was involved in. Me and a few friends were in a  VC, and one of them was playing Jurassic World Evolution and had two dinosaurs named Chad and Alpha Male, so they fought and Alpha Male won. But the next day at 10am, Chad 2 was set to fight Alpha Male. Once most of the people left the vc, me and one of my friends, who went by Lil Yom at the time, decided to make this song in preparation for the big fight between the dinosaurs the next day. Thats how this song came about. <br> At this time, I was going by the name Timegen.

                    My first song as P Slimer. The name came from the P in my name, and also because I was the slime god. A couple of my friends sent me an invite link to a BandLab project, so I joined and wrote and rapped 1 verse. Nothing ever came of this song, and honestly I forgot about it.
