            <h1>The Cream Day Era</h1>
            <div class="Title-Description">
                The Cream Day Era saw me joining a pseudo band with a few of my friends. Containing of P Slimer, lil kc (the new name of Lil Yom), and Jimmy Frankfurt Da Rappa. We only really released one song as a trio, but there were a few songs leading up to the release of Greetings Loved Ones. <br> The idea with Cream Day was to make... freaky parodies.

                    The Official Release version of Greetings Loved Ones. Freaky j was cut, and the final member of Cream Day was featured; Jimmy Frankfurt The Rappa. This song  actually had some effort put into it than any before. However, it was very freaky. Just ignore this... <br> This was released on BandLab - and later - Soundcloud, and I believe did get a music video.

                    The original version of Greetings Loved Ones. Me and lil kc were up late at night again and we decided to make a song again. We decided to make a classical parody of California Gurls. It was pretty clapped. At this point it was just me, lil kc, and freaky j. Freaky j never ended up recording on this, but he will come back later, trust me... <br> This was released on BandLab.

                    This was the first song I ever released solo on BandLab. I had a midi keyboard and was messing around with it, trying to play some melodies. I started recording and playing Mary Had a Little Lamb and I messed it up a few times. But i persevered and after I finished recording, I decided to add drums. And after that, I added some vocals over it. <br> This was released on BandLab - and later - Soundcloud.

                    To be honest I dont really know the story behind this. I just made some weird non-music soundscape of a concert with some crowd members being heard. See if you can pick them all out. <br> This was released on BandLab - and later - Soundcloud.
