  "pageDescription": "After [X] was released, Jizza and I wanted to release another song in the [XYZ] trio. So the same night as [X] released I got started on another beat. I wanted to use a sample as an intro like a lot of Instagram prods were doing at the time, so I used another thing that was popular at the time; Alvin and the chipmunks getting cracked. So I started making the beat and it was sounding pretty good so I sent it to Jizza, and he thought it was good too so we decided to hop on it.",

[Y] is considered the worst song out of the trilogy, it was sloppily made, poorly mixed, had clapped vocals, a corny intro, and bad mixing.\nNot much to be said about this song, other than it took longer than [X] to finish, and the song cover was very lackluster.",
